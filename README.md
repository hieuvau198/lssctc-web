Hệ Thống Quản Lý và Mô Phỏng Cho Trung Tâm Đào Tạo Tài Xế Xe Cẩu  

## 1. Overview  
LSSCTC is an integrated platform combining training management and a 3D crane operation simulator. It reduces safety risks, lowers operational cost, and improves trainee readiness before using real equipment.

## 2. Problem Context  
Traditional crane training faces:  
- High cost and limited availability of real cranes  
- Safety risks for beginners  
- Fragmented tracking of trainee progress  
- Lack of consistent evaluation and feedback  
- Limited exposure to varied real-world scenarios  

## 3. Proposed Solution  
- Centralized management of trainee profiles, schedules, course content, and performance history  
- Realistic 3D virtual crane operation environment  
- Instructor tools for task assignment, monitoring, and feedback  
- Scenario-based simulations for diverse operational conditions  
- Analytics-driven evaluation supporting certification decisions  

## 4. Core Features (Planned)  
- Authentication & role-based access (Admin / Instructor / Trainee)  
- Trainee profile & progression tracking  
- Training schedule & session management  
- Performance metrics dashboard  
- 3D crane operation simulator (environment, physics, scenarios)  
- Real-time instructor monitoring & feedback channel  
- Scenario library (weather, load types, fault conditions)  
- Reporting & export (progress, competency, certification readiness)  

## 5. High-Level Modules  
- User & Role Service  
- Training Management Service  
- Simulation Engine (3D + Physics)  
- Scenario Orchestrator  
- Performance Analytics & Scoring  
- Notification & Messaging  
- Storage (Sessions, Logs, Metrics)  
- API Gateway / Frontend UI  

## 6. Benefits  
- Safer onboarding for beginners  
- Lower training downtime and equipment dependency  
- Objective skill measurement  
- Faster remediation through targeted feedback  
- Scalable for multiple cohorts  

## 7. Roadmap (Initial)  
1. Requirements & domain modeling  
2. Data schema & service skeleton  
3. Basic trainee/instructor portal  
4. Simulation prototype (core physics + controls)  
5. Scenario management & scoring  
6. Analytics & reporting layer  
7. Optimization and usability polish  

## 8. Abbreviation  
MSSCT = Management and Simulation System for Crane Driver Training Center  

## 9. Internationalization Note  
Primary languages: English / Vietnamese (future UI i18n planned)

## 10. Getting Started (Placeholder)  
- Prerequisites, stack, and setup instructions to be added after architecture finalization.

## 11. License  
To be defined.
